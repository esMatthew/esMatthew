- Hi, I’m @esMatthew, im just a regular 17 year old kid that's interested in programming, though I'm not good at it
- I’m interested in learning how to code, of course, but also other things like robotics, mechatronics, etc...
- I’m currently learning c++, swift, and a little bit of html and css. I'm also trying to learn Arduino, but I'm not good at that either
- I’m looking to collaborate on easy, beginner friendly projects that may enhance my passion and knowledge about the subject, but that are not so important that I may screw the project up pretty badly
- How to reach me: mateo.escobar.jurado@icloud.com
